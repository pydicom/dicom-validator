# Dicom Validator Release Notes
The released versions correspond to PyPi releases.

## Planned changes for 0.8 release

For Python 3.14 support, we depend on the (yet unreleased) pydicom 3.1.
In line with pydicom, support for Python 3.9 will be removed in that version.

## Unreleased

### Changes
* added typing to production code
* the result dictionary generated by `IODValidator.validate()` has changed to an instance
  of `ValidationResult`, and the log messages in the result have been replaced by error codes
* changed `--revision` to `--edition` to conform to DICOM vocabulary, deprecated
  `--revision`; also renamed `revision` to `edition` elsewhere in function names
* logging the errors has been decoupled from validation via an error handler argument
* do not count non-DICOM files as errors, if not using `--force-read`

### Features
* added support for conditional enum values

### Fixes
* tags not allowed in multi-frame functional groups have been listed
  as errors twice (see [#196](../../issues/196))
* fixed handling of enum values for a specific tag
* fixed handling of multiple definitions for referenced enum values
* fixed handling of conditions in functional groups (see [#226](../../issues/226))
* fixed crash when looking up tags in functional groups with lazily-decoded DICOM files
* fixed error count for functional groups

### Infrastructure
* added Python 3.14 to CI (currently needs development version of `pydicom`)
* removed support for Python 3.9
* added initial documentation on `ReadTheDocs`
